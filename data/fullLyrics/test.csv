mama-bake-a-pie-daddy-kill-a-chicken,bobby-bare,Country,"People starin' at me as they wheel me down the ramp toward my plane
The war is over for me I've forgotten everything except the pain
Thank you sir and yes sir it was worth it for the old red-white-and-blue
And since I won't be walking I suppose I'll save some money buying shoes
The bottle hidden underneath the blanket over my two battered legs
I can see see the stewardess make over me and ask were you afraid
I say why no I'm Superman and couldn't find a phone booth quite in time
A G-I gets a lotta laughs if he remembers all the funny lines
Mama bake a pie daddy kill a chicken your son is comin' home 11:35 Wednesday night
Mama will be crying daddy's gonna say son did they treat you good
My uncle will be drunk and he'll say boy they do some real great things with wood
The letter that she wrote me said goodbye she couldn't wait and lots of luck
The bottle underneath the blanket feels just like an old friend to my touch
I know she'll come and see me but I bet she never once looks at my legs
She'll talk about the weather and the dress she wore the July 4th Parade
Lord I love her and I don't believe this bottle's gonna get her off my mind
I see here in the paper where they say the war is just a waste of time
Mama bake a pie daddy kill a chicken your son is comin' home 11:35 Wednesday night"
thinking-about-you,bill-monroe,Country,"Now as I sigh the hours away
I think of love of yesterday
Now I know she's gone away
She's in heaven so they say
Will the angels tell her for me
That my love will never die
Someday I'll walk along beside her
On that golden way up there
Now all my life I lived so gaily
Until she had to go away
Then she left me oh so lonely
She lies at rest beneath the clay
Each night I think about you dear
I wonder if you'll hold me then
When I meet you up in heaven
We'll have life eternal there"

You don't have to worry anymore

Shut the light, shut the shade

I'll be your baby tonight
Oh well, that mockingbird is gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
And that big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But we're gonna let it you won't regret it
Kick your shoes off do not fear
Oh, bring that bottle over here
I'll be your baby tonight
Oh well, that mockingbird is gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it

ride-em-cowboy,david-allan-coe,Country,"Traveling with the rodeo
It's the only life I'll ever know
I started in New Mexico
Must have been a thousand years ago
I used to be the best they say
At riding young wild horses for my pay
But now I'm much too old it seems
I only rides wild horses in his dreams
They use to tell me, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down
You can't make no money if you hit the ground
They say, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down
You're the toughest cowboy in town
I have always been a traveling cowboy
But now there's no place left to go
What in I supposed to do
Seems I'm left out in the cold

You can't make no money if you hit the ground
They say, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down
You're the toughest cowboy in town
Oh midnight was the champion
He is the only bronc I couldn't ride
But now I hear old Midnights blind
And rides little children for a dime
Ladies used to hang around
I must have been a hero in their eyes
My silver spurs are rusted now
Lord, I wished I tried to settle down
They use to tell me, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down

any-old-stretch-of-blacktop,collin-raye,Country,"I got money in my pocket
And a guitar in my hand
These lonely nights without you
Are more than I can stand
I work like a puppet but it's time
To cut the strings
Well I hit the ground running
And I won't be looking back
I'll be like a locomotive
Headed down a one way track
It won't take too long
Just you wait and see
As long as it will lead me back to you
Any old stretch of blacktop will do
North, south, east, or west
Been everywhere it seems
Hotels rooms and honky tonks
Don't feel like home to me
I'll be stepping out the rhythm
While I'm singing a brand new song
And it's knowing where I'm going
That will keep me moving on
Turn my collar to the wind
And put my thumb up in the air
Flag a diesel down
Or catch a bus from anywhere
Colorado, California or even Kalamazoo
As long as it will lead me back to you
Any old stretch of blacktop will do
I hit the ground running
Alright"
white-silver-sands,ernest-tubb,Country,"Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon white silver sands
Where on the brink of love I kissed her and obeyed my heart's command
Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon white silver sands
We watched the sunset in the evening in a far and distant land
Oh here beneath God's blue heaven there's a place I must go
And the sunset in the evening is the only love I know
Where the deep blue pearly waters...
[ guitar + piano - steel ]
We watched the sunset in the evening seen the moon still low and pale
Watched the gaucho ride the pinto out across the pampas trail
Where the deep blue pearly waters...
And obeyed my heart's command"
flowers-won-t-grow-in-gardens-of-stone,don-williams,Country,"Could it be our love wasn't planted deep enough
Or could it be we just didn't try
Looking back we see so much that we left undone
We should have known it would wither and die
Flowers won't grow in gardens of stone
The ground must be tended but we left it alone
The seeds that we scattered are all parched and blown
Flowers won't grow in gardens of stone
Thinking bout it now it was only pride I know
There was so much that we wouldn't give
Both of us in time took what might have been a home
And made it a place where nothing could live
Flowers won't grow..."
drivin-wheel,emmylou-harris,Country,"Well, all I want is a love that's hot
Can't be sold, can't be bought

None can rob and none can steal
Hey, love that moves like a drivin' wheel
Well, all I want is drivin' wheel
All I want is a drivin' wheel
All 'round love my ideal
Well, all I want is love that's right
To hold onto with all my might

open-ended-life,avett-brothers,Country,"Pack a change of clothes and a pillow for the road
for when you drift off to sleep
Put the sketches and the notes in the box labeled 'burn with furniture'
We will watch the fire burn the whole entire house we built
down to ashes
From the mirror we'll admire how the flame quickly retires
We won't waste a long goodbye on the smoke or foolish lies
that finally passed us
I was taught to keep an open-ended life
And never trap myself in nothing
Let's find something new to talk about
I'm tired of talkin' about myself
I spent my whole life talkin' to convince
everyone that I was something else
And the part that kinda hurts is I think it finally worked
and now I'm leaving
I get the feeling things have changed
But the mystery to me is where and when along the way
Did anyone decide that they believed me
I was taught to keep an open-ended life
And never trap myself in nothing
I was told to keep an open-ended life
To never trap yourself in nothing
When we settle down in another nowhere town
let's tell our neighbors
We won't be here long and we'll be quiet
but don't go askin' any favors
I can't stand the unexpected uninvited visits
from too many strangers
My trust has dwindled down
And I can leave just as abruptly as I came here
I was taught to keep an open-ended life
And never trap myself in nothing
I was taught to keep an open-ended life
To never trap yourself in nothing
I was taught to keep an open-ended life
And never trap myself in nothing"

Say south of Preston Firs,
Have you ever been up in a holler,

Digging that black coal in those dark mines, those dark mines,
If you had, you might just understand
The reason that they left it all behind

Pull up in a holler about two a.m.

To hold those little grand kids in their arms, in their arms
Yet, I'm proud to say that I've been blessed

born-to-breathe,front-242,Electronic,"Kick it where it hurts and you kick it hard
What does the future hold for me? Pain!
In the world outside everything's the same
When you look in the mirror what do you see? Shame!
You play with yourself then you cry when you start to bleed
You put over numbers you pretend that you don't need
It's hard for you to give when all you do is you take and you take
I'll give you something
A flower at your fucking wake
Born to breathe
Not much else
You'll die of nothing
Like everybody else
Born to breathe
Nothing is what I am
No-one to save me
From myself
I can't see
Blind is what I am
Swimming for the womb
Like everybody else
What's yours is yours and what's mine is also yours
'Cause you had to wait, I'd be crawling on all fours
I give you the finger but you want the whole hand
The hand that slaps you and makes you understand
Born to be here
Nothing is what I am
No-one to save me
From myself"

Do you dream of places close to me?
I don't know how to make this right
I never thought I'd ever breath so tight
Confusing, the issues underneath
I don't know how to find this place
locked in a box inside a cage far away
Singing songs for rainy days
And I want to tell you
But words so clumsy are not my friends
They starve these thoughts when they begin
And I still need you to know
But my lips are tightly holding back
The sentiment inside is lying trapped
Higher, higher than the skies above
And deeper than the cells within
I love you more than these
And I love you more than they
Three splinters hide below this shell
Where yesterday provided me this hell
And left me, lifeless, empty
And you're asking for more than I can give
But it takes so much air for us to live
Completely, I understate my haunted dreams
I really don't want to sleep just yet -
I think about this...as I lie in bed
Let me forget, the color of my death
I know it's not fair to live this way

Please murder
My face was watching braille dogs
Hammering out belonging to the sky
Their wings form shutters
From Alan's window
The incense drifts past the skins and shells
Ruby waves goodbye
And runs to the valleys
That are beautiful
And drenched with rain and colours
And green was that blood then
The sap of monsoons and butterflies
When I was small the red flowers opened
And I broke letters and dreamed
Or murder and nations and Crowley's jazz
4 or 5 decades later
I am some Egyptian face
Was I in Luxor carving my name?
Was I binding cats with kindness and saws?
The green glass stinks with ash
In the broken windows
Remembered bodies
Fill the streets with novels
And the brave boys pass by
In brave pontoons
And mark graves
With pebbles that sink and shriek jingles
What was the lie in your showboat?
Or your slowboat? Were the paperweights
Calling you to statis? Or murder?
Was your soul at KostKutters or Kwiksavers?
The cats lie under pink lights
And see themselves as ponies with fur
Whilst Judas arises 4 centuries too late
And says ecce homo an
I was not the creator at the dawn or evening
But the trains walk by to Toytown
And call for fares from the wooden front
You and I were walking the calypso
Howling for teatime
At teatime the conquistadors and matadors
Are salvators and astronauts
The sea was bloody red and coupled with fury
Anyway murder they say
Anyway murder"

the-rebel,dubliners,Folk,"I am come of the seed of the people, the people that sorrow;
Who have no treasure but hope,
No riches laid up but a memory of an ancient glory
My mother bore me in bondage, in bondage my mother was born,
I am of the blood of serfs;
The children with whom I have played, the men and women with whom I have eaten
Have had masters over them, have been under the lash of masters,
and though gentle, have served churls.
The hands that have touched mine,
the dear hands whose touch Is familiar to me
Have worn shameful manacles, have been bitten at the wrist by manacles,
have grown hard with the manacles and the task-work of strangers.
I am flesh of the flesh of these lowly, I am bone of their bone I that have never submitted;
I that have a soul greater than the souls of my people's masters,
I that have vision and prophecy, and the gift of fiery speech,
I that have spoken with God on the top of his holy hill.
And because I am of the people, I understand the people,
I am sorrowful with their sorrow, I am hungry with their desire;
My heart is heavy with the grief of mothers,
My eyes have been wet with the tears of children,
I have yearned with old wistful men,
And laughed and cursed with young men;
Their shame is my shame, and I have reddened for it
Reddened for that they have served, they who should be free
Reddened for that they have gone in want, while others have been full,
Reddened for that they have walked in fear of lawyers and their jailors.
With their Writs of Summons and their handcuffs,
Men mean and cruel.
I could have borne stripes on my body
Rather than this shame of my people.
And now I speak, being full of vision:
I speak to my people, and I speak in my people's name to
The masters of my people:
I say to my people that they are holy,
That they are august despite their chains.
That they are greater than those that hold them
And stronger and purer,
That they have but need of courage, and to call on the name of their God,
God the unforgetting, the dear God who loves the people
For whom he died naked, suffering shame.
And I say to my people's masters: Beware
Beware of the thing that is coming, beware of the risen people
Who shall take what ye would not give.
Did ye think to conquer the people, or that law is stronger than life,
And than men's desire to be free?
We will try it out with you ye that have harried and held,
Ye that have bullied and bribed.

Its a mad world to be stuck on the livin
And its a heart breaker, to succumb to forgettin
I keep wishing for something that gets in my way
And my path is a jungle, it's got too much to say
Outlive me, outlive me
I love you too much
Rubies and emeralds,
Sapphires and such
Outlive me, outlive me
I love you too much
Coal into diamonds,
Ashes and dust
There is a fire in place of a stone
Softens the letters and it takes you back home
Where once it was written, the lines we obeyed
Now tenderly questions the choices we've made"
mary,cecile-corbel,Folk,"Mary is a sailor
Dreaming of northern shores
Lost galleons on the sea
Mary ever on her way
O can you sail and come back?
O can you leave away?
Temples of gold and hidden lands
Mary, I don't want to wait
Knocking on the door, he came by
Knocking on the door, he tried out
Knocking on the door, he turned back
Mary, won't you marry me?
Mary is a corsair
Dreaming of (old) treasures
Wild tempest on the sea
Mary ever on her way
O can you hear the foghorn?
O can you see the waves?
Ivory foam and gloomy rain
Mary, I don't want to wait
Knocking on the door, he came by
Knocking on the door, he tried out

Mary, won't you marry me?

Mary was a sailor
But she is drowned to die
She sleeps under the sea
Mary ever on her way
Waited for a long time
Longed to see her face
My love's under the sea
She will never marry me
Oh Mary...
Oh Mary...
Tell me just one...
Mary, won't you marry me?

When I asked you how you'd been
You told me you were fine
But I knew it was a lie
Because I could see the lines
Of tiredness on your brow
And the tension in your eyes
II
Yet to another's face
There would have been no trace
Of trouble in your day
To one who'd never seen
The shadow of your dreams
Or the strangeness of your ways
CHORUS
To one who didn't know you
Or want to touch and hold you
To one who didn't need you
Who'd never learned to read you
To one who didn't love you,
Wasn't aching just to hug you
You'd look fine
To one who didn't know your crazy mind
You'd look fine.
III
I knew you'd have a friend
Waiting in the bar
'Cause that's the way you are
She looked like she was kind
And spoke with strength of mind
That had served her well so far.
But I hoped that she was tough
And wouldn't hurt too much
When you'd decide to go
And I swear I almost died
When I saw in her eyes
The image of my own.

Yeah, we can read!
Yeah, literacy!
Oh Newfoundland, oh Newfoundland, ya island in the sea
I love you oh so very much, I joined the Ministry
To show you people 'round the rock when tourist season's here
Although in my opinion it' s a gem throughout the year
Well if you're one for swimming, don't think it's outta reach
You can go and take a dip along Groswater Beach
I know the name's misleading, that's quite a problem here
Instead let's go to Goobies and have ourselves a beer
From Woody Point to Come-By-Chance to good ol' Ferryland
Come take a look at Gander, Blackhead's mighty grand
Don't let the names deceive you, Newfoundland's mighty fine
So spend a night on Dildo if you think you've got the time
Well you can go to Blow-Me-Down before it get's to dark (GASP)
Oh sorry ma'am, I should have said, that's our provincial park
There's also Whippet Harbour, or maybe Butter Pot
Or maybe I'll just hit the pub I'm feeling like a shot
Well you can sail on Quidi Vidi, or look at Joe Batt's Arm
There's Placentia and there's Cow Head (MOOO!), they're so full of charm
Get married down in Kilbride, have a party in Hate Bay
Or have some screech in Fogo and forget about the day
From Woody Point to Come-By-Chance to good ol' Ferryland
Come take a look at Gander, Blackhead's mighty grand
Don't let the names deceive you, Newfoundland's mighty fine
So spend a night on Dildo if you think you've got the time
Okay, the Drinkin' Verse

craftsmanship,buck-65,Hip-Hop,"Most folks spend their days daydreaming of finding clues
My whole life I've been here at the train station shining shoes
I started when I was nine, on my own and taught myself
No complaints, I'm doing pretty good and I got my health
Memories and callouses, my hearing's probably next to go
Sometimes I do a little handywork for extra dough
But mostly this here is how I spend my time
And I've perfected a technique I call the dry shine
Some guys use lots of water on the shoe but then when it's out in the open air
The shine is gone in 10 minutes
That whole approach to the job is dumb, in fact
Dollars to donuts, that customer won't be coming back
This is the most common mistake of the amateurs
Going for big numbers to satisfy their managers
Anyway, the dry shine, the first thing I mean to do
And this part is very important
I clean the shoe: the residue and old polish
To keep a shoe from being ruined all you need to do is use a rag with some cleaning fluid
If the shoe's all caked up with gunk you need to think
The shoe can't breathe and that's what causes the feet to stink
They took Carfoine off the market, I believe
It was a few years ago, 'cause that leather couldn't breathe
Now once you've cleaned the shoe and it's dried
Your base coat of polish can now be applied
Then you brush, 'cause what that tends to do
Is clean the shoe a little more and gets rid of the residue
And then you do the second coat just like the first one
You brush it, you rag it, and voila, your work is done
And that's it
You treat each shoe like it's special
Care about your work, and be a professional
There's a right way to go about your job and a wrong one
I find this way is much better in the long run
It ain't about the dollar or trying to go fast
Unless you take pride in what you're doing you won't last
Craftsmanship is a quality that some lack
You got to give people a reason for them to come back
The world's a different place than what I was introduced to
They don't wear shineable shoes like they used to
Casual clothes in the office, what is this?
The villain in sneakers is killing my business"
believe-in-a-dollar,cassidy,Hip-Hop,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts
And it's magic, if the music is groovy
It makes you feel lovely like an old time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryin' to tell a stranger 'bout rock and roll
If you believe in magic don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start a-tappin' and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind
If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until mornin', 'til there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancin', baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
Yeah do you believe in magic
Yeah believe in the magic of a young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Woh, talkin' 'bout magic
Do you believe in magic
Do you believe in me
Do you believe in magic
Believe in me
Do you believe in magic
Do you believe in me
Do you believe in magic"

Automatic bubble yo, straight off the Benz
Dac double Daniel unrockable fam milk the same yo
Fuck you, Duel of the Iron, Tony win a Oscar

Tongue kiss the neck and it's, mucus from a locust

Rap's under seige, Guyanese guns
I got European funds, my ice don't melt
Shaolin is felt, mathematics is my rod
And my staff, I pray like this
I break mics in half, shit realism
Fuck Moet and Baguettes, that get paid off
Or get laid off, I spray New York
I'm an angel, at war with the rappers
Good black women sleep over at Cappa's

It ain't enough room for y'all cats to sound chop
In a class by myself I hold the foundation
Face to face, I make my affiliation
Short and brief, I make out with the looseleaf
In the struggle, ten years after the beef
I choose to come forth then pronounce my sin
If it's not the felonies or the color of my skin
I'ma keep switchin' my gear, again and again
From the trainin' camp I drive past V.I.N.
It be Wu Wear for life, my team is top billin'

There's a certain mystique when I speak,
that you notice that's sorta unique,
cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep,
and I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat,
you can't sit still, it's like tryin to smoke crack
and go to sleep, I'm strapped,
just knowing any minute I could snap,
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped,
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically,
it ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry,
it ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
for you to play me, it's cockamanie,
you just ain't zaney enough to rock with Shady,
my noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clocks cuckoo,
I got screws loose, yeahhh, the whole kit an' kaboodle,
I'm just brutal. It's no rumour, I'm numero uno, assume it,
there's no humour in it no more, you know
I'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag,
you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
you better love me... bitch

The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner', but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da

[1st VERSE from ""Like Toy Soldiers"" : EMINEM]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Suge
And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it i understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause

We fell in love huh just to fall apart now

What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?

Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call
Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls
Issues that I had, some say it comes from not seeing my dad, keep moving on
Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch
Girl, my heart is broke and I needa crutch
Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up
Ass got me layed up, girl I never gave up
On you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough
I know your young and you gotta live your life ma
I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya

Got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face

I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
Then I looked at your mama like damn your sons a disgrace
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I'm tryna clean my house, I walkie talkie my maid
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
This shit make no sense, I got taste
Girls come to my house to have an orgy parade
I just hit 'em like this and leave 'em horny for days
My daddy said I'm a prince, now I'm a king
He sacrificed and went to Heaven, now I'm livin' his dream
You gotta walk like this, you gotta talk like that
I talked this shit into existence, now my stock's on racks

Racks on top of stacks and stacks on top of them racks
Move like that on them cats, you move like that and get smacked
I wipe a hundred on my bump, I'm using that like Proac'

Pillow case on his head
No more breathing time
An ambulance sped
Sped 'round every corner
Calling out his name
Shot a rabbit from the back seat window
Sat and watched the summer corn grow
Ate ice cream in a desert dream
And got lost in father's singing
Too hot inside
Too hot outside
Lazy days when I said let's go for a ride
We'd sail on Spirit Lake
Me, my pappy and his lemonade
Tim and Tina were my parents' names
They got engaged
They were inflamed
Seduced by the light of butterflies
How they shimmer, how they glimmer
Those butterflies
We seven kids
We almost died
Nearly put to death
By lightening strikes
Instead there was hot, pink
Flashes in the sky
We climbed the rocks, in snow and rain
In search of magic powers
To heal our mother's pain"

Have you ever thought about your soul, can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay your grave
Is God just within your head or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a namethat you read in a book when you were at school?
When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope---Do you think he's a fool?
Well I have the truth. Yes I have seen the light and I've changed my ways.
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scaredat the end of our days.
Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believed in God above
They should realize before they criticise
That God is the only way to love.
Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer whemn death is near
And say they might as well worship the sun.
I think it is true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad that the opinion you had was the only one voiced.
Will you be so sure when your day is near say you won't believe?
You had a chance but you turned it down now you can't retrieve.
Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realize that he is the one,
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate.
Or will you still jeer at all you hear?
Yes---I think it's too late."
relentless-intolerance,demon-hunter,Metal,"These eyes, they will gaze and reflect
And gauge every thought I reject
Now sway of stance in changing times
Just a narrow mind commanding respect
We stand on the words of the wise
And languish every call to despise
We know the hollow side of their lies
No reformed edition, never losing vision
Now into forever, only getting better
Ways of now, spiral down
How much more we allow
Keeping sight of the vow we made
Never changing
Holding fast to the hope
Never losing ground
So when we stand in the line of wrath
Never changing
True and righteous will know
Never losing ground
The foundations that we used to uphold
Now regarded as the madness of old
Every alteration made to the standard of truth
Is a nail in the coffin we hold
We embody everything they despise
'Cause they see us through degenerate eyes
So when they cast you down as intolerant filth
Stand firm, never bow to the lies
No reformed edition, never losing vision
Now into forever, only getting better
Ways of now, spiral down
How much more we allow
Keeping sight of the vow we made
Never changing
Holding fast to the hope
Never losing ground
So when we stand in the line of wrath
Never changing
True and righteous will know
Never losing ground
See the scorn inside my eyes
No reformed edition, never losing vision
Now into forever, only getting better
Keeping sight of the vow we made
Holding fast to the hope
So when we stand in the line of wrath
Never changing
True and righteous will know
Never losing ground
Keeping sight of the vow we made
Never changing
Holding fast to the hope
Never losing ground
So when we stand in the line of wrath
Never changing
True and righteous will know
Never losing ground"

Youre sitting happy in gloom
Fate worries you, you will not give her room.
You give credit for might, inspiration and sight.
But you miss the point.
You wont join the fight,
You think to use is to lose so your clinging, pulling pleading.
Try and keep it safe.
Keep it cosy but it feels so out of place
Youre feeling a loss but youre not fit to make it
You offered so much but youre frightened to take it.
It never was really proved, never was understood.
But there really is no virtue in the good.
The shoutings so loud that theyd do better to mime
Youre deafened and you cannot hear the rhyme.
But secrets in whispers pull you, try to tempt you.
Try and keep it safe
Keep it cosy but it feels so out of place
Youre feeling a loss but youre not fit to make it
You offered so much but youre frightened to take it.
You beg for help and advice, how to handle your life.
But you dare not move, you cannot pay the price.
Chances slip, you just chatter, flatter, to forget what matters.
Spout your lines, read all your books,
You hear the sounds, miss all the hooks,
Your best is what you least understand,
You hate the graft, wont join the race,
Youre scared to scar your pretty face
Safe now cos your head is in the sand

From behind their sable masks

Their luminous eyes catch my every word;
Tonight's the night the tables turn
You've had your chance and now at last
You've been found guilty by the order of the cat
You've changed our laws and now because of that
Your going to live in the claws of a cat
Talons on and operating
We're sure that you're cooperating
Straighten up that feline face
And put your footsie pads in place
Practice up your katsy glance
And imitate my cat like stance
Tonight's the night the cats return
We'll corner them by the alley wall
Bite and scratch them until they fall
Lap their blood and steel their young
Finish them off just for fun
Tonight's the night the cats will run
Mommy I hear the cat at the door
I think he's cold will you let him in?
Lay them out and leave our mark
A cat scratch angle above the heart
On we'll go to another house
To play the game of cat and mouse
Why do you plead when we don't care?
We're the cats and we don't scare
You've had your turn and now it's ours

And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them, I admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around

Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them

pizza-day,aquabats,R&B,"Well I remember my first day of public school
I was very scared of getting pummeled
And sure enough i did at first recess
I got pegged in the head by a big red ball
And stumbled, my head hung
Back to class with a bloody nose
and soon it was lunch time
Mom said I should ask about how poor kids there get fed
So i got a book of tickets and a scedule and it read
(chorus)
Monday: hotdogs
Tuesday: Tacos
Wednesday: hamburgers and chocolate milk
Thursday: sloppy joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was pizza day, the best day of the week
All the kids would line up super early just to eat
Monday: hotdogs
Tuesday: Tacos
Wednesday: hamburgers and chocolate milk
Thursday: sloppy joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was pizza day, the best day of the week
It always came with salad and a side of pork and beans
Hooray for pizza day
Hooray for pizza day
I miss pizza day
The best day of the week
Well i remember my first day of Jr. High
I had hairspray in my hair and my pants were way too tight
And all the breakers and new-wavers and the rockers and the preps
Would all be in their places on the front lawn or the steps
I hung out with some punker kids who used to make me laugh
Got thrown in the dumpster by some rich kids near the caff
As time went on we figured out it was totally uncool
To eat the welfare lunch
Provided by the school
So in poser punker fashion we just mooched off all the kids
And lived off eating candy bars and bags of nacho chips
(chorus)
Well now I'm out of school and i don't have a job (you're a slob)
I just sit around all sweaty and lethargic
And i'm just thinkin' 'bout where it all went wrong
Why I can't concentrate on anything but reruns
I wish i had some more stability and I
I wish I had somebody makin' lunch for me
I guess I miss the simple things in life
The thought of pizza day
I thought it stupid then but I wish I had it now
I just want
(chorus)
Hooray for pizza day
Hooray for pizza day
I miss pizza day...
Best day of the week
Says Michael Jackson of Ensino California.
When he's not in his little theme parks,
He's eating pizza with the kids.

Hey, grab a slice buddy!!

accidental-pimp,30-dirty-thoughts,R&B,"It was a dark and stormy night, and the bar was packed
I took a long hard pull on Jimmy, John and Jack
My buddies were a mess, we all looked like shit
and I was scanning round the place for any targets to hit
I said what next can I get some rough sex
Can I find a victim for my next conquest?
and just when I lamented
that the night was circumvented
in walked three fine young contented
foxy fine females!
We rolled on up, and I tipped my hat
thinking time to show these ladies where the cool kids at
We didn't mean no harm, and I was dripping with charm
but their cool reaction said we'd bought the farm
Their eyes cold frost, told us all to get lost,
get the hell away, begone at any cost
but just when doom was looming
conversation was resuming
and then they began consuming
some tequila shots!
Everybody knows somebody
who can't control their alcohol
And when they've lost those inhibitions
accidental pimps can have it all
As we watched from afar we saw 'em gulping it down
There was so much liquid flowing that I thought they would drown
We knew at that point that they were deep in a binge
and we had an opportunity to take our revenge
so we found a couple guys looking desperate as hell,
said for a hundred bucks that they could have some tail
then I pointed to the threesome,
said it was my little harem,
all they had to do was grab'em
and the night was theirs!
Everybody knows somebody
who can't control their alcohol
And when they've lost those inhibitions
accidental pimps can have it all
What I did was wrong, but those chicks were gone,
Within moments it was on like donkey kong
They never figured out what we'd gone and done,
and selling their ass paid for our night of fun
I say what now, got a new cash cow,
I'm the new king, milk years out of this sow
Just when you've made the grade,
in this game you always played,
threw yourself on the grenade,
and you're finally getting laid,
who d'ya think is getting paid?
Everybody knows somebody
who can't control their alcohol
And when they've lost those inhibitions
accidental pimps can have it all
Everybody needs some money
(you're drinkin, I'm pimpin, you've lost it, don't know it)
at least to buy some alcohol
(you're drinkin, I'm pimpin, you've lost it, don't know it)
And when your wallet's nearly empty
(you're drinkin, I'm pimpin, you've lost it, don't know it)
accidental pimps can have a ball
(you're drinkin, I'm pimpin, you've lost it, don't know it)"

Hot air blows up balloons in my dreams
Ding-dong rings the bell
Something's at the door
So I put on my slippers
And I creep across the floor
For the door from hence I heard
Another ding dong
I peep through the door hole
But something's very wrong
As on my porch
There are thousands of snakes
Ready to strike
I feel queasy and
My knees start to shake
My perilous fate
I see no escape as serpents lay seige
To my country estate
The Devil must have opened up hell's gates
and called up millions of snakes
To take me from this place
Big ones Little ones
Fat ones Skinny ones
Protect me from their venomous drug
That springs from the needles of fangs
Attacked by Snakes
By Snakes
So many snakes
You could fill the grate lakes
With snakes
Ha ha ha run
I try to hide
But snake bites on my face testify
I've been attacked by snakes
By snakes so many snakes
It would take a thousand crates
To contain the snakes after me
I'd rather be burned at the stake
Than be attacked by snakes
Welcome to my world
Or should I say this land of snakes
Serpents lie and wait
At every take my knees quake
As my life these snakes invade
Snake invaders show their fangs
On the snake parade
My perilous fate
I see no escape
As my family prays and waits
I fight them off with
Shovels and rakes and
Bats and bones
But I just can't seem
To shake these foes
That slither from the dark
To destroy my home
[Chorus]
One snake, Two snake
Are there any more?
There's two more
Knocking at my door..."
it-s-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year,brian-mcknight,R&B,"It's the most wonderful
Time of the year
With the kids
Jingle-belling
And everyone telling you
Be of good cheer
It's the most wonderful
Time of the year
It's the hap-happiest
Season of all
With those holiday greetings
And great happy meetings
When friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest
Season of all
There'll be parties
For hosting
Marshmallows for roasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago
It's the most wonderful
Time of the year
There'll be much
Mistletoe-ing
And hearts will be glowing
When loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful
Time of the year"
thursday,fatima-mansions,Rock,"The windows watch me wait for you
Mirror mirror, mirror mirror
I've seen a world beyond their view
Mirror mirror, mirror mirror
Of course the night times are the worst
Of course I burn with an evil burst
You exist so I am cursed
Mirror mirror, mirror mirror
Mirror mirror, mirror mirror
I'll be good 'till Thursday comes
The world will think I never had
an idea that could drive me mad
I'll be good 'till Thursday comes
then burn all good away
I weed my house, I wash my trees
Mirror mirror, mirror mirror
I cross my legs in front of me
Mirror mirror, mirror mirror
I tingle at the thought of you
Is this what the humans do?
My childish words just don't ring true
See ya later, great dictator
In a while, [nadaphile?]
I'll be good 'till Thursday comes
Well, unless I am misleading you
You shine me up and make me new
I'll be good 'till Thursday comes
and wish I never did say
I'll be good 'till Thursday comes
It's such a lot of fun
to watch the liar I've become
but I'll be good 'till Thursday comes

So soon you will learn to forget
Bad times, the rules and regrets
One day they won't reach out for you
So you put out the fires you set
As smoke fades from your last cigarette
You're a mess but yes you're beautiful
Oh come on down we can't drown in this water
It's only gonna set us free
Come on now we can't drown in this water
You been prayin for a remedy
Who really cares about fatal mistakes
Trailer park dreams don't carry much weight
In the long run you've got nothing to prove
So go, run while you can still get away
Take a breath while its still yours to take
You're a mess but yes you're beautiful
Oh come on down we can't drown in this water
It's only gonna set us free
Come on now we can't drown in this water

goodnight-saigon,billy-joel,Rock,"We met as soulmates
On Parris Inland
We left as inmates
From an asylum
And we were sharp
As sharp as knives
And we were so gung
ho to lay down our lives
We came in spastic
Like tameless horses
We left in plastic
As numbered corpses
And we learned fast
To travel light
Our arms were heavy
but our bellies were tight
We had no homefront
We had no soft soap
They sent us playboy
They gave us bob hope
We dug in deep
And shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ
with all of our might
We had no cameras
To shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe
And played our Doors tapes
And it was dark
So dark at night
And we held onto each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together
Remember Charlie
Remember Baker
They left their childhood
On every acre
And who was wrong
And who was right
It didn't matter
in the thick of the fight
We, held the day
In the palm of our hands
They, ruled the night
And the night, seemed to last
as long as six weeks
On Parris Island
We held the coastline
They held the highland
And they were sharp
As sharp as knives
They heard the hum of the mortars
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together"

Here I am alone waiting for you to come with me

I'm what you wanted
I'm what you wanted
I'm what you wanted don't lie to me
I'm what you wanted
I'm what you wanted
I'm what you wanted don't lie to me
Left me here alone destroyed the heart I have given you
Emptiness inside is all I have left for now
Why did you run can't deny the feelings you have for me
Betrayed by this life understanding this fallen love we have
WHY, WHY, WHY

You hope to die before you wake
And I had a dream that I would take you away

And I'd like to free you
And I won't deceive you

Pain is scalding you, you
Can you believe in any good
When you've been hurt and misunderstood
With no such thing as the ""goodness of men""
To redeem myself from others sin

You play with yourself then you cry when you start to bleed
You put over numbers you pretend that you don't need
It's hard for you to give when all you do is you take and you take
I'll give you something
A flower at your fucking wake
Born to breathe
Not much else
You'll die of nothing
Like everybody else
Born to breathe
Nothing is what I am
No-one to save me
From myself
I can't see
Blind is what I am
Swimming for the womb
Like everybody else
What's yours is yours and what's mine is also yours
'Cause you had to wait, I'd be crawling on all fours
I give you the finger but you want the whole hand
The hand that slaps you and makes you understand
Born to be here
Nothing is what I am
No-one to save me
From myself"

And the look we gave each other said we both need a friend
Is this the first time you've come here in all the nights you've been alone
Just searching for something that just wasn't at home
How long has it been when's the last time he kissed you
My you sure look lovely in that dress so tight and thin
There's a look in your eye that cries somebody love me
And I wonder how long has it been
I sat down at your table and we shared a drink or two
And all the things that first look told me now I find are really true
Someone's neglect has left an emptiness where love used to be
Then you reached out and touched my hand softly whispered to me
How long has it been when's the last time she held you
Made you feel wanted needed and loved
There's a look in your eyes that cries somebody love me
And I wonder how long has it been"

Still sleepy and yawning (too much)

There's too much on my mind and I can hear it
Calling for the d-i-n-c-o

Nah, I'm not running, I'll just say no
And go and tell my homeboy jerell

Is a stench of fuel in the air.

And I don't want to die!
